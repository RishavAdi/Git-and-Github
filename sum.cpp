    int number1, number2, sum;

    printf("Enter two integers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &number1, &number2);

    // calculate the sum
    sum = number1 + number2;      

    printf("%f+ %d = %d", number1, number2, sum);
    return 0;
}
Run Code
Output

In this program, the user is asked to enter two integers. These two integers are stored in variables number1 and number2 respectively.

printf("Enter two integers: ");
scanf("%d %d", &number1, &number2);
Then, these two numbers are added using the + operator, and the result is stored in the sum variable.

sum = number1 + number2;
